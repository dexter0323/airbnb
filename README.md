# Airbnb Clone

This project is a clone of the popular vacation rental platform, Airbnb. It is created for the purpose of practicing and honing frontend and backend development skills.

## Frontend

The frontend of this application is built using [Astro.js](https://astro.build/). Astro.js is a front-end framework that allows you to build faster, modern websites with less client-side JavaScript.

## Backend

The backend of this application is built using [Golang](https://golang.org/), also known as Go, is a statically typed, compiled language with clean syntax and efficient concurrency handling.

## Setup
